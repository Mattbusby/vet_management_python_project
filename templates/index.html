    <div class="column"><b><u>Do you ever wonder why your pet needs its annual boosters?</u></b>
        <p>07 January 2022<br>
        Let's look at why annual visits are important for your pet.<br>
        You're probably aware that when you get a puppy or kitten, you're going to need to visit the vet for vaccinations, flea and tick prevention and other treatments. However, to maintain your pet's health and wellbeing, regular trips to the vets are recommended. Annual vaccinations or boosters are important to protect your pet against preventable diseases and discomfort. Here we explore some of the common questions, and myths, around the annual visit for vaccinationâ€¦ <br>
        
        My pet only had its primary vaccines, is that okay?<br>
        
        It is a misunderstanding amongst some pet owners, that following the vaccination, pets are protected against diseases for the rest of their lives. Unfortunately, that isn't the case and can cause the expense of their puppy or kitten's health and, in extreme cases, the loss of a pet.<br>
        
        Some clients may have the misconception that an annual vaccination is just for the commercial benefit of the pharmaceutical company or vet - again, this isn't true.Your pet should be vaccinated as a puppy and then get regular boosters throughout their life. <br></p>
